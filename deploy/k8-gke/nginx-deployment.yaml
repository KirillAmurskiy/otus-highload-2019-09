              # Using `GET_HOSTS_FROM=dns` requires your cluster to
              # provide a dns service. As of Kubernetes 1.3, DNS is a built-in
              # service launched automatically. However, if the cluster you are using
              # does not have a built-in DNS service, you can instead
              # access an environment variable to find the master
              # service's host. To do so, comment out the 'value: dns' line above, and
              # uncomment the line below:
